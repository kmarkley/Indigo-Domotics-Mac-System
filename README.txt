Indigo Automation Plug-in for managing disk volumes and applications running

This plug-in allows to declare as devices : disk volumes and applications.

For disk volumes :
- allows to mount/unmount volumes,
- has an option to force unmount,
- prevent sleeping (option) of volumes,

For Application :
- launch/quit application.
- as an option to force quit application

Typical use of this plugin is managing an iTunes instance as a media server, on the same mac than the Indigo server. 
The kind of scenarios I use are :
- Turn on the media service :
   - When the house wakes up, a trigger turns on the raid disk (using a reay device)
   - When the disk volume is mounted (i.e. disk volume device becomes on), a trigger launches iTunes by setting the Application device to On
   - Then you can use iTunes Plug-in or Airfoil plugin as usual
- Turn off the media service :
   - When the house goes to sleep, a trigger sets the application device to off to stop iTunes,
   - When iTunes device is off, a trigger unmount the disk volume (i.e. sets disk volume device to off),
   - When the disk volume is off, then the raid drive relay device is set off.
